24/60/60 time isn't the best we can do. This clock runs on something better.

1 day = 100,000 seconds = 100 hours = 1000 minutes
1 hour = 1% of day
1 second = .864 "old" second

This has several advantages:
  - More precise with less digits
  - More natural counting rhythm (I tend to rush when counting seconds in my head.)
  - More intuitive time management (If a task takes 5 hours, that is 5% of your day)
  - I'm sure there are more...

"See you at 72 o'clock!"
